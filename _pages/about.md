My name is Julia Stabinska and I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Michael T. McMahon at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I completed my Ph.D in physics at the Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf, working under the supervision of Dr. Hans-Jörg Wittsack. Prior to that, I received both my B.S and M.S in biomedical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology.

I have broad interests in renal magnetic resonance imaging, and have worked on clinical implementations of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the kidney. During my doctoral studies, I investigated magnetization transfer properties of several most abundant kidney metabolites and optimized the acquisition and post-processing protocols for measuring CEST signals in renal transplant recipients. After finishing my PhD project, I focused on studying renal microstructure and function using advanced DWI methods.

In my post-doctoral research with Dr. McMahon, I develop novel CEST tools for simultaneous monitoring of renal pH and perfusion in patients with renal dysfunctions. Furthermore, I am interested in adopting multi-parametric MRI to study structural and functional changes in radiation-induced nephropathy.
