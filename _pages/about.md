Julia Stabinska is a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Michael T. McMahon at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She completed her Ph.D in physics at the Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf, working under the supervision of Dr. Hans-Jörg Wittsack. Prior to that, she received both her B.S and her M.S in biomedical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology.

She has broad interests in renal magnetic resonance imaging, and has worked on clinical implementations of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the kidney. During her doctoral studies she investigated magnetization transfer properties of several most abundant kidney metabolites and optimized the acquisition and post-processing protocols for measuring CEST signals in patients with renal transplants. After finishing her PhD project, she focused on studying renal microstructure and function using advanced DWI methods.

In her post-doctoral research with Dr. McMahon, she develops novel CEST tools for simultaneous monitoring of renal pH and perfusion in patients with renal dysfunctions. Furthermore, she is interested in adopting multi-parametric MRI to study structural and functional changes in radiation-induced nephropathy.
