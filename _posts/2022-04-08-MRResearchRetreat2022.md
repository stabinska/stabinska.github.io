Away from our normal workspace and routines, we've just spent two very exciting days full of great presentations, stimulating discussions and fun activities during the 25th MR Division Retreat in Dewey Beach, DE.
I genuinely enjoyed the opportunity to learn about great research being conducted in our department.
I am also particularly happy and honored that my presentation "DCE-MR CEST Urography for characterizing urinary tract obstructions" was awarded with the best presentation prize.
